The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is revolutionizing how we connect LLMs to existing data sources. Instead of building custom brittle integrations, we can now expose data safely.

## The Problem with Legacy API Integration

Most e-commerce stores run on legacy PHP monoliths (Magento, custom layouts). Building an AI agent that "knows" your inventory usually involves:
1. Scraping the site (brittle)
2. Building a custom API just for the AI (expensive)
3. Dumping SQL into a vector DB (stale data)

## Enter MCP

MCP provides a standardized way to expose resources (files, database rows) and tools (functions) to an LLM.

```typescript
const server = new McpServer({
  name: "Magento-Adapter",
  version: "1.0.0"
});
```

By wrapping your legacy logic in an MCP server, you create a "universal adapter" that any AI client (Claude, Cursor, custom agents) can talk to.

## Real-World Impact

For e-commerce businesses, this means:
- **Inventory queries** without exposing your entire database
- **Order processing** with built-in validation
- **Customer support** that actually knows your product catalog

The future of AI integration isn't about replacing your stack—it's about making it accessible to agents through standardized protocols.
