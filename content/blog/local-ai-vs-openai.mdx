GDPR compliance is the elephant in the room. Can you send customer PII to OpenAI? Often, the answer is "No".

## Llama 3 on Consumer Hardware

We benchmarked Llama 3 8B on a standard MacBook Pro M3 vs a hosted Azure endpoint. The results were surprising.

For RAG tasks (Retrieval Augmented Generation), local models often outperform larger models because the *context* is more important than the *reasoning* power for simple lookup tasks.

## The Privacy Advantage

Running AI locally means:
- **No data leaves your infrastructure**
- **GDPR compliance by default**
- **No per-token costs**
- **Predictable latency**

## When to Use What

**Use OpenAI/Claude when:**
- You need cutting-edge reasoning
- Data privacy isn't a concern
- You're prototyping quickly

**Use Local AI when:**
- Handling customer PII
- Operating in regulated industries
- Need predictable costs
- Want full control

## The Dutch Context

For businesses in the Netherlands, GDPR isn't optional. Local AI isn't just a nice-to-have—it's often a **requirement**.

The good news? Models like Llama 3 are getting good enough for most business use cases, especially when combined with RAG.
