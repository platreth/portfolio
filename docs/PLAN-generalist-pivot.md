# Plan: Generalist AI Builder Pivot

> **Goal:** Reposition Hugo as a "Solo AI Builder" who leverages 7+ years of Engineering Reliability (PHP) to deliver end-to-end Agentic Workflows.
> **Key Themes:** Execution > Consulting, Reliability at Scale, Agentic Automation.

## Phase 1: The "Solo Builder" Hero

Refactor the opening statement to emphasize *autonomy* and *delivery*.

- [ ] **Hero Headline (`app/(site)/page.tsx`)**
  - **New:** "I Build Autonomous AI Workforce Solutions."
  - **Sub:** "Senior Engineer (7y+) helping organizations deploy reliable agentic workflows. From concept to production code."
- [ ] **Value Props ("Why Me?")**
  - **Generalist Edge:** "Don't hire a siloed AI researcher. Hire a builder who knows the database, the API, *and* the LLM."
  - **Reliability:** "Bringing backend stability to the chaos of generative AI."

## Phase 2: Agentic Capabilities (Show, Don't Just Tell)

Refine "AI Labs" to be more "Product-Focused".

- [ ] **Rename "AI Labs" to "Agentic Blueprints"**
  - Frame these not as "experiments" but as "solutions I can deploy for you".
- [ ] **Update Cards:**
  - **Customer Ops Agent:** "Handles support tickets, refunds, and CRM updates autonomously."
  - **Data Analyst Agent:** "Talk to your SQL database in plain English. No hallucinated schemas."
  - **Legacy Sentinel:** "An agent that monitors and refactors old PHP codebases 24/7."

## Phase 3: The "Full-Stack + AI" Narrative

Connect the PHP past to the AI future.

- [ ] **"What I Do" Section (New/Refactor)**
  - Move away from just listing tech stacks.
  - **Pillars:**
    1.  **Strategy:** "Identifying high-ROI AI use cases."
    2.  **Engineering:** "Building the RAG pipelines & Vector DBs."
    3.  **Integration:** "Connecting Agents to your existing PHP/Laravel apps."

## Phase 4: Verification

- [ ] **Tone Check:** Does it sound like a "Builder" (Action-oriented)?
- [ ] **Clarity Check:** Is "PHP" framed as a strength (Reliability)?
- [ ] **Mobile Check:** Ensure the new copy flows well on mobile.
